This is a book template constructed based on the classicthesis template created by Professor Andr√© Miede (https://miede.de/).

I use this template to summarize and present my research experience/accomplishments in the past ten years. I personally find it really satisfactory.

You can customize the .sty files for your particular needs, as what I did for my "book".
